# RANetplayer tools

RANetplayer is a tool now distributed with RetroArch which records and replays
netplay sessions. Its intention is to function as a testing framework for
RetroArch, but may also be useful for all the reasons anyone would want to
record anything.

These tools convert things to RANetplayer's format, which is just raw RetroArch
Netplay data. Their function is for test verification against other emulators:
A recording made with an emulator should behave the same under the equivalent
core on RetroArch.
